        <h1> Making 24-hour Solar Flight Possible</h1>

        
        <p>The goal of Project Mobius is to create a long endurance solar aircraft that utilizes solar cells. The project started with Dr. Graham Doig who at the time was a professor at Cal Poly SLO. Dr. Doig created a team of students to prototype a solar aricraft with the goal of a boxed-wing or joined-wing aircraft. Doig was able to lead the team for two years before leaving Cal Poly. In his time three different variants of Mobius have been designed and built. The Mk1 was the Radian XL Gilder, provided by our advisor Dr. Doig, with integrated solar cells on the wing. The Mk2 was our first wing, built by our team, made from balsa ribs, 3D printed parts, and a carbon spar. The Mk2 had many successful flights in the spring of 2018 at the Cal Poly Aerospace Experimental Flight Range (EFR). The Mk2 supported our design choice for the solar cell incorporation, but unfortunately, there was a crash, and the wing was damaged. The Mk3 was a completely new aircraft built entirely by the team. A new foam and film composite wing was manufactured and attached to a built up fiberglass pod. The Mk3 is a successful design, and its record flight was over six hours. The Mk3 suffered a crash the fall of 2019. The Mk4 is the final solar aircraft, and will be supplied with batteries to allow for a 24-hour solar flight. Dr. Paulo Iscold is overseeing the project and the aircraft is currenlty being manufacutred. The MK4 will attempt the 24-hour solar flight in the summer of 2021.</p>
